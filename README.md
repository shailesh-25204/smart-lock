# smart-lock
Following is the COMPLETE Process to start the Smart Lock Device:

1.	Install and Start the Local Blynk Server(Local Server Files and Installation Link are provided).

2.	Connect the Virtual COM port to the Server.(Virtual COM port is required just for simulation and
	not for actual project)
	For that you need to go to Arduino/libraries/Blynk/scripts
	and run the file blynk-ser.bat

3.	Upload sketch to Arduino ( In this case we will upload hex file to Arduino board).

4.	Start the simulation.
